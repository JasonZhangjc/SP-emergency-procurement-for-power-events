Stochastic Programming of Emergency Procurement for Power Events

Developed a 2-stage stochastic programming model of emergency procurement for external emergency crews to address power events in a Toronto. Leveraged the extensive form, single-cut/multi-cut benders decomposition, and the level method for solutions. Applied the conditional value at risk (CVaR) as well as sample average approximation to measure the risk. Reduced expected loss by 16\%} under emergency.
